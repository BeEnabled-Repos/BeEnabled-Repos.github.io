# BeEnabled

## Mission

BeEnabled designs accessibility for work, classrooms, and everybody. We believe accessibility is a universal language that knows no gender, race, class, or creed. We're building a world where disability does not mean inability, where everyone has independent access to basic human needs.

## About the Founder

Jen, the founder of BeEnabled, has struggled with limited dexterity for her entire life. During her second year of college, while pursuing her dream to become a software developer, she acquired an illness that left her with good use of only four of her fingers. Like 11.7 million Americans with limited dexterity, Jen's body could no longer keep up with her brain.

A recent Camelback Ventures Fellow, Ohio State University alumna and President's Prize winner, Jen is a serial innovator working to design a more accessible world.

A subscription-based system that gives users control over their health through an individualized process that helps determine if someone needs an ambulance. The system addresses a critical problem: $8 billion worth of unneeded ambulance trips are taken each year, creating a huge financial burden on the chronically ill. A consenting bystander is easily directed via an app to call 911 or a preferred emergency contact.
